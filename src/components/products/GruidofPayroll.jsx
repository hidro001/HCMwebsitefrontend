                <p>An HCMS (Human Capital Management System) is a type of HR software that enables the management of several HR functions through the use of information technology.</p>
                <p>An HCMS aims to improve the productivity and efficiency of the business through the automation of manual and repetitive tasks. This, in turn, also frees up the HR teamâ€™s time. The additional bandwidth can then be used to address more strategic, business-critical tasks in the human resource management function.</p>
                <p>An HCMS typically covers every element of an HRIS and includes the capabilities of human capital management system.</p>
                <span>The two popular characteristics of a typical HRMS are Payroll and Time & Labor Management (TLM). "Some of the HCMS vendors have [HRIS + (Payroll + TLM) = HCMS] whereas few have [HCM + (Payroll + TLM)]"</span>

                <h3 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl">What Are the Common Functions of HRMS Systems?</h3>
                <p>Human Resource Management (HRM, or simply HR) is a function in every organization which is designed to increase employee performance in aligning with employer's strategic objectives. Primarily focused on how people are managed within organizations, human resource management is driven by systems and policies. HR involves the following sub-functions and an HRMS helps automate and streamline them:</p>

                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Manpower Planning</h4>
                <p>Human Resource planning mainly emphasizes the estimation of resource required in order to achieve the desired business results. HR plans can be either short term/immediate or long term/strategic. A good HRMS can certainly enable the HR team to execute these plans swiftly and effectively.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Recruitment</h4>
                <p>Recruiting employees with the right mix of skills and competencies at the right time is a critical task. It includes filling positions through initiatives like promotions, internal job posting and employee referrals.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Onboarding</h4>
                <p>A candidate who has agreed to join an organization would report to work on a particular day. This day is called the Joining Date. There are a certain set of activities that are done on the first day of the employee joining the organization. These activities are called Employee Onboarding. A complete HRMS software can make the entire process easier.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Confirmation</h4>
                <p>After an employee joins, normally, he goes through what is referred to as a Probation Period of 1-6 months. In this period, the organization and the employee review each other and decide on whether each of them would like to continue the association with the other. At the end of the Probation period, the employee would normally go through a confirmation process.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Employee Information Management</h4>
                <p>One of the important activities done by the HR department is maintaining accurate information about the employees. Some of the critical pieces of data that need to be maintained include:</p>
                <ul className="p-5">
                    <li className="list-disc">Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Joining Date, Contact Information, Telephone numbers, email-ids, etc</li>
                    <li className="list-disc">Previous employment information</li>
                    <li className="list-disc">Information regarding Department, Location, Grade, Reporting Manager, etc., of the current company</li>
                    <li className="list-disc">Payment & Statutory information like PF number, ESI number, Income Tax PAN, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Apart from the above, HR also maintains information on Passport, Visa, Nominations, Company Assets, etc. One of the most critical jobs of the HR department is to ensure that the correct and updated information of the employees is maintained. A lot of organizational decisions by the managers and management are taken based on this data.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Leave Policy and Transaction Management</h4>
                <p>One of the jobs of the HR Department is to formulate or manage the Leave Policy of the organization. Apart from creating the HR policy, the HR Department is also responsible for maintaining all transactions that happen. An HRMS can simplify this Herculean task. It is a statutory (legal) requirement to give Leave to employees in an organization.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Salary Changes and Increment Calculations</h4>
                <p>HR Departments are involved in fixing or revising the salary of employees in consultation with the Business Heads. A typical salary revision is accompanied by a Salary Revision letter. This information is also passed on to the Payroll team who will include it in the next payroll. Also, employees can view the changes in the company's HRMS software.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Payroll Processing and Salary Disbursement</h4>
                <p>Payroll processing is an extremely critical activity for both the organization and the employee. It is directly related to one of the core reasons an individual works for an organization apart from statutory compliance. Payroll processing also involves the calculation of all statutory dues (employee and employer contributions) and generating the necessary reports. An HRMS software will execute all this automatically.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Separation Process</h4>
                <p>When an employee submits his/her resignation or simply quits the job, it's usually called a resignation. The HR Department is responsible for ensuring that all the work involved in this process happens. The work involved would be to do an exit interview, ensure that all clearance certificates are issued, handover is done and complete information is passed on to Payroll.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Communication and Basic Employee Services</h4>
                <p>One of the functions of an HR Department is to enable and ensure a regular channel of communication between the organization and the employees. Employees need to be made aware of various policies like the Leave Policy, Attendance Policy, Travel Policy, Dress Code, etc. All of this will be usually available in the company's HRMS software.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Employee Engagement</h4>
                <p>HR Departments are steadily undergoing a change from being a very transaction-oriented function to a more strategic one. One of the keys to the success of an organization is to have employees whose requirements and goals are aligned to those of the organization. HR Departments play a vital role in building this alignment.</p>
                <img src="/images/GuidofPerformance/hcms1.png" alt="imageofGuid-perfomrmance1" />
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Statutory Compliance</h4>
                <p>Another critical function of the HR Department is to ensure that the organization is compliant with all the relevant laws of the region (State/Country). They need to ensure that they are aware of these laws and take up all activities that are needed to ensure that this is fulfilled.</p>
                <ul className="p-5">
                    <span>The various activities that are part of statutory compliance are:</span>
                    <li className="list-disc">Ensuring that all relevant employee and labor-related licenses and permissions are obtained</li>
                    <li className="list-disc">Onboarding all current and new employees into various schemes as applicable to the organization</li>
                    <li className="list-disc">Calculating various Payroll-related deductions from the employee salary based on the applicable laws</li>
                    <li className="list-disc">Ensuring that timely reports are submitted to the relevant authorities as per the mandated schedule. Report submission may be online or through the filing of the hard copy.</li>
                    <li className="list-disc">Ensuring that when an employee leaves the organization all relevant statutory forms and certificates are issued to him</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">MIS Reports</h4>
                <p>HR needs to submit multiple reports to the stakeholders. These reports are presented periodically (weekly, bi-monthly, monthly, etc.) and are in a pre-defined format available in their HRMS software.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Training and Development</h4>
                <p>This function focuses on upgrading the knowledge and skills of the employees. New joinees are trained on the product and processes of the Organizations. Employees are also trained in various soft skills such as team building, leadership skills etc.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Performance Appraisal and Promotions</h4>
                <p>Performance evaluation is a systematic activity which helps an organization to determine the extent to which employee is delivering aligned to business results. HR specialists design and implement the Performance Management system (PMS) and maintain the records.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Succession Planning</h4>
                <p>Succession Planning is the process where an organization identifies employees who can move into positions of higher responsibilities and constantly grooms them so that they are capable of achieving these positions.</p>
