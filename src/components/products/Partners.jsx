                <p>Human Resource Management (HRM, or simply HR) is a function in every organization designed to increase employee performance in aligning with employer's strategic objectives. Primarily focused on how people are managed within organizations, human resource management is driven by systems and policies. HR involves the following sub-functions, and an HRMS helps automate and streamline them:</p>

                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Manpower Planning</h4>
                <p>Human Resource planning mainly emphasizes the estimation of resources required in order to achieve the desired business results. HR plans can be either short-term/immediate or long-term/strategic. A good HRMS can enable the HR team to execute these plans swiftly and effectively.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Recruitment</h4>
                <p>Recruiting employees with the right mix of skills and competencies at the right time is a critical task. It includes filling positions through promotions, internal job posting, and employee referrals.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Onboarding</h4>
                <p>A candidate who has agreed to join an organization would report to work on a particular day. This day is called the Joining Date. Activities done on the first day of joining are called Employee Onboarding. A complete HRMS software can make this process easier.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Confirmation</h4>
                <p>After an employee joins, they typically go through a Probation Period of 1-6 months. In this period, the organization and the employee review each other and decide whether they would like to continue the association. The employee then undergoes a confirmation process.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Employee Information Management</h4>
                <p>One of the critical jobs of the HR department is maintaining accurate information about the employees. Some of the essential data to maintain include:</p>
                <ul className="p-5">
                    <li className="list-disc">Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Joining Date, Contact Information, etc.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>HR also maintains information about Passport, Visa, Nominations, Company Assets, etc. It's essential that this data is accurate and up-to-date as it is used for organizational decisions.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Leave Policy and Transaction Management</h4>

                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Communication and Basic Employee Services</h4>
                <p>HR ensures regular communication with employees regarding various policies, procedures, and organizational updates. HRMS software provides a platform to facilitate this communication.</p>
                <h4 className="font-bold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mt-6">Employee Engagement</h4>
